  <div class="entry-content"><p>We have received some updates on negotiations from PCS regarding the future of our members on FTA contracts. If you are on a FTA contract we would encourage you to have a look and share with your colleagues. Updates will also be shared in the workplace as we receive them.</p>

<blockquote><p>PCS remains fundamentally opposed to HMRC&#8217;s proposal not to renew the majority of FTA contracts when they are due to end in March 2014.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We have recently issued a short newsletter which you should have had dropped on your desk, or will shortly. There are some updates from PCS you may not have seen yet, and we would encourage all members to stay up to date on current developments as they will affect all of us.</p>

<h2>Successful negotiation of increased annual leave allocations</h2>

<p>We would encourage all members to <a href="http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/revenue_and_customs_group/latest-news/index.cfm/successfull-negotiation-of-increased-annual-leave-allocations-in-personal-tax-operations-in-january-february-and-march">read this update on annual leave allocations</a> as it also includes information on a package of measure PCS are negotiating with management to reduce some of the pressures members are experiencing at work.</p>

<p>In a few weeks we would expect to see a detailed proposal on these measures from management, and would expect to give all members the chance to express their views on these measures in a consultative ballot.</p>

<h2>Branch update</h2>

<p>Our branch reps are continuing to represent members from Quorum as usual. Details on contacting us have been desk dropped over the last few days but you can contact any of our reps from the list <a href="/about">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There has been a lot of activity in the group around Christmas, much of which is relevant to us at Quorum.</p>

<h2>Extension to FTA Contracts &amp; Increase in Hours for Permanent Staff</h2>

<p>It was announced in December that FTAs in our location who are eligible will have their contracts extended to September 2013. This couldn&#8217;t have been done without the union&#8217;s push to convert TFTAs to FTAs, and was very welcome news before Christmas.</p>

<p>PCS will continue to argue the case for Personal Tax to be staffed by permanent, public sector workers and therefore we will continue to push for permanent jobs for our FTA members and for an end to the job cuts in Personal Tax.</p>

<h2>Public sector jobs to replace private in Lillyhall CC</h2>

<p>Lillyhall is one of the two locations that HMRC is trialling the involvement of private sector providers in our contact centres, so it was good to learn that HMRC intend to recruit 70 new FTAs in an attempt to improve performance. It is hoped that many of the workers currently employed by Sitel will be able to secure employment with HMRC.</p>

<h2>Building capacity trial - PCS response to HMRC&#8217;s 9 month update</h2>

<p>PCS have <a href="http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/revenue_and_customs_group/latest-news/index.cfm/id/889FC336-EE51-4873-A9F6CBD7E1AACDB8">published their response to HMRC trials here</a>. They will continue to oppose the use of private sector companies in our contact centres. Further information will be available when the evaluation finishes in the Spring.</p>

<p>This will be a difficult year for many of us in Quorum, but your local branch will be here as ever to support and advise you. Branch nominations are open now for our last elections in this office so if you have ever considered being more involved now is the time.</p>

<p>We would also like to invite all members to attend our Annual General Meeting next month. These are very well attended and give you the opportunity to be involved in the decision making process of your union. There will also be a question and answer session, so please take the opportunity to ask any questions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The union has issued a branch briefing reporting back from a recent meeting of the National Executive Committee detailing decisions made on the ongoing campaign.</p>

<p>The NEC has agreed plans for a campaign focusing on pay and conditions. They will be writing to employers setting out our demands and calling for negotiations.</p>

<p>The government&#8217;s reponse will be assessed in January, with a national ballot for a programme of industrial action to follow if the employer&#8217;s response is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Further details <a href="http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/pcs_comment/index.cfm/id/9F3A6A1F-C63E-42A3-A19BA9F633A75A61">can be found on the PCS website</a>, and in a branch briefing from your local reps.</p>

<p>A fresh ballot will be necessary due to the new focus of the campaign, and the previous national ballot being held 18 months ago.</p>

<p>The union are pursuing a pay claim for 2013 which includes lifting the pay freeze and 1% cap currently in place, arguing for a minimum 5% or £1200 increase (whichever is greater) and the concept of a living wage to underpin all pay policies.</p>

<p>The current concerns over the &#8216;review&#8217; of our terms and conditions will form part of the dispute.</p>

<p>There are also ongoing issues over union facility time, <a href="http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/pcs_comment/index.cfm/id/C00AB256-4E59-4EFF-B39357028F604931">further increases to pension contributions</a> which will be imposed in April 2013, as well as further job cuts and privatisation worries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Christmas is approaching, we know a lot of our members will be counting the cost. As we have effectively been in a pay freeze for some years now, and below inflation rises even before that, many PCS members are finding it hard to meet rising costs.</p>

<p>PCS has recently launched a credit union which offers a new alternative to members wishing to save and take out low cost loans, without having to resort to high interest providers on the high street. The credit union is not looking to maximise its profits, like the big banks, but to serve the needs of its members.</p>
