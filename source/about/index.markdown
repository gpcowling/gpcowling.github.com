Who we are
----------

Quorum branch has represented members of the Public and Commercial Services Union at the contact centre since its opening in 2004.

Our branch consists of trained representatives who provide support, advice and representation on workplace issues, working in partnership with management where possible to resolve issues quickly and effectively on your behalf.

If you are looking for advice please contact one of the reps below. Your questions will be dealt with sensitively and in confidence.

The branch

Even the most self-reliant person can have an accident or get sick, which can result in disciplinary action. If you join us after you encounter a problem at work we may not be able to help you. Join today, and work with us to fight for better terms and conditions, working environment, good public services and to combat discrimination and prejudice when they arise.
