As Christmas is approaching, we know a lot of our members will be counting the cost. As we have effectively been in a pay freeze for some years now, and below inflation rises even before that, many PCS members are finding it hard to meet rising costs.

PCS has recently launched a credit union which offers a new alternative to members wishing to save and take out low cost loans, without having to resort to high interest providers on the high street. The credit union is not looking to maximise its profits, like the big banks, but to serve the needs of its members.

What is it?
-----------
A credit union is owned and run by its members, who legally must have a 'common bond' linking them together. In our case it is membership of a trade union, although it can be based on geography, or by an employer.

The credit unions are regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and operate under a statutory framework. All members of PCS can join, as well as immediate family/partners provided they live in the same household.

PCS members run the union, and ultimate responsibility rests with a board of directors who are members themselves.

Joining the credit union
------------------------
Every member commits to save regularly, with a minimum of £10 per month. Every £1 buys a share in the credit union.

The initial joining fee is £5 which will be deducted from your first deposit. In subsequent years an annual £1 charge will go towards administration costs.

After members have saved for 3 months, they will be eligible to apply for a loan. The amount of money and repayment terms will depend on the period and value of savings, purpose of loan, amount requested and character of the member. Members will initially be able to borrow up to 3 times the amount they have saved.

No arrangement fees are charged on loans and there are no penalties for early repayment. All loans will be protected by life insurance.

All savings are fully protected by the FSA.

You can get more information or [join the credit union on the PCS website](http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/about_pcs/pcs_credit_union/index.cfm).
