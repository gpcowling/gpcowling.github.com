We have recently issued a short newsletter which you should have had dropped on your desk, or will shortly. There are some updates from PCS you may not have seen yet, and we would encourage all members to stay up to date on current developments as they will affect all of us.

Successful negotiation of increased annual leave allocations
------------------------------------------------------------
We would encourage all members to [read this update on annual leave allocations](http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/revenue_and_customs_group/latest-news/index.cfm/successfull-negotiation-of-increased-annual-leave-allocations-in-personal-tax-operations-in-january-february-and-march) as it also includes information on a package of measure PCS are negotiating with management to reduce some of the pressures members are experiencing at work.

In a few weeks we would expect to see a detailed proposal on these measures from management, and would expect to give all members the chance to express their views on these measures in a consultative ballot.

Branch update
-------------
Our branch reps are continuing to represent members from Quorum as usual. Details on contacting us have been desk dropped over the last few days but you can contact any of our reps from the list [here](/about).
