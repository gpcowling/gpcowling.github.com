Mary Glindon, the MP for North Tyneside visited Quorum to present learning reps with the prestigious unionlearn Quality Award for their IAG (information, advice and guidance) provision in the workplace.

The award is awarded to organisations that are committed to working with trade unions, and can demonstrate that unions and union learners are considered in the design, development and delivery of courses. The learning team at Quorum demonstrated clearly they provide expert level advice to hundreds of staff.

The award was presented to the learning team by Kevin Rowan, unionlearn Regional Manager, and the ceremony was attended by Mary Glindon.

This is the most recent in a long line of successes for the learning team here at Quorum. If you would like any advice on getting started on a course, please contact one of the ULRs.
