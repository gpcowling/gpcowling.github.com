The union has issued a branch briefing reporting back from a recent meeting of the National Executive Committee detailing decisions made on the ongoing campaign.

The NEC has agreed plans for a campaign focusing on pay and conditions. They will be writing to employers setting out our demands and calling for negotiations.

The government's reponse will be assessed in January, with a national ballot for a programme of industrial action to follow if the employer's response is unsatisfactory.

Further details [can be found on the PCS website](http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/pcs_comment/index.cfm/id/9F3A6A1F-C63E-42A3-A19BA9F633A75A61), and in a branch briefing from your local reps.

A fresh ballot will be necessary due to the new focus of the campaign, and the previous national ballot being held 18 months ago.

The union are pursuing a pay claim for 2013 which includes lifting the pay freeze and 1% cap currently in place, arguing for a minimum 5% or Â£1200 increase (whichever is greater) and the concept of a living wage to underpin all pay policies.

The current concerns over the 'review' of our terms and conditions will form part of the dispute.

There are also ongoing issues over union facility time, [further increases to pension contributions](http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/pcs_comment/index.cfm/id/C00AB256-4E59-4EFF-B39357028F604931) which will be imposed in April 2013, as well as further job cuts and privatisation worries.
