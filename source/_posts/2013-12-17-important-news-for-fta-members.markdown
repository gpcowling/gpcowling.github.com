We have received some updates on negotiations from PCS regarding the future of our members on FTA contracts. If you are on a FTA contract we would encourage you to have a look and share with your colleagues. Updates will also be shared in the workplace as we receive them.

> PCS remains fundamentally opposed to HMRC's proposal not to renew the majority of FTA contracts when they are due to end in March 2014.

Following negotiations the department has announced plans to offer more than 1,000 FTA workers a further extension to their contracts.

While the exact details are yet to be worked out, PCS negotiators have had further meetings with the employer and will issue further information shortly, in order to keep FTA members informed.

PCS still insist that further job cuts are unnecessary, and will do everything possible to save the jobs of our FTA members.

Further information can be found [on the PCS website](http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/revenue_and_customs_group/latest-news/index.cfm).

If you have any questions please contact one of our reps and we will ensure your concerns are escalated.
