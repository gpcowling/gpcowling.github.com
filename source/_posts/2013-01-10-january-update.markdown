There has been a lot of activity in the group around Christmas, much of which is relevant to us at Quorum.

Extension to FTA Contracts & Increase in Hours for Permanent Staff
------------------------------------------------------------------
It was announced in December that FTAs in our location who are eligible will have their contracts extended to September 2013. This couldn't have been done without the union's push to convert TFTAs to FTAs, and was very welcome news before Christmas.

PCS will continue to argue the case for Personal Tax to be staffed by permanent, public sector workers and therefore we will continue to push for permanent jobs for our FTA members and for an end to the job cuts in Personal Tax.

Public sector jobs to replace private in Lillyhall CC
-----------------------------------------------------
Lillyhall is one of the two locations that HMRC is trialling the involvement of private sector providers in our contact centres, so it was good to learn that HMRC intend to recruit 70 new FTAs in an attempt to improve performance. It is hoped that many of the workers currently employed by Sitel will be able to secure employment with HMRC.

Building capacity trial - PCS response to HMRC's 9 month update
---------------------------------------------------------------
PCS have [published their response to HMRC trials here](http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/revenue_and_customs_group/latest-news/index.cfm/id/889FC336-EE51-4873-A9F6CBD7E1AACDB8). They will continue to oppose the use of private sector companies in our contact centres. Further information will be available when the evaluation finishes in the Spring.

This will be a difficult year for many of us in Quorum, but your local branch will be here as ever to support and advise you. Branch nominations are open now for our last elections in this office so if you have ever considered being more involved now is the time.

We would also like to invite all members to attend our Annual General Meeting next month. These are very well attended and give you the opportunity to be involved in the decision making process of your union. There will also be a question and answer session, so please take the opportunity to ask any questions.
