Next Wednesday 4 September is the final Learning at Work Day for our branch. The event will be held throughout the day in Quorum 4, and time will be allocated for everyone to attend and have a look at the stalls. We have a number of learning providers coming along, as well as other companies.

We hope to make this, our last event a big success before the office closes. Our learning team look forward to seeing you all on the day.
